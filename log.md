### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: April 19, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the ViT pre-work code I submitted; and sat through 2 hours of coding instruction (8-10 pm) and coded along during class exercises. Downloaded Live Server extension for Visual Studio. 

**Thoughts** I've recently started to pick back up basic coding. I enjoyed the AP level C++ course in high school and scored a 4/5 on the exam but that was over a decade ago! After having completed a paid bootcamp but being very taxed during a busy period at work and life, the concepts were digested in the moment but fleeting in the long run. I just stated a 4 week, sponsored, front end web dev bootcamp for veterans.

### Day 5: April 23, 2021 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Re-watched HTML Crash Course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE

**Thoughts** This will take some re-visiting of prior course recordings and resources provided. Learning this material at the end of a work day is not conducive to a morning person!

### Day 7: April 26, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on Assignment 1; Sat through 2 hours of coding instruction (8-10 pm), was introduced to more CSS tools. 

**Thoughts** What the Font seems to not work properly for the assignment. It keeps giving me different fonts (sans serif vs serif font suggestion) for the same image depending on how the image is viewed.
